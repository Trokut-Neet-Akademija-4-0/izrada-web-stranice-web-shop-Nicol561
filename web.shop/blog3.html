                <h2>Common Acrylic Paint Pouring Problems (and How To Avoid Them)</h2>
                <p>I'm not going to lie - I thought paint pouring was a doddle! How hard can it be to mix some acrylic paint in a cup and then pour it out onto a canvas? Well, I stand corrected! In this post I will share with you the numerous mistakes and mishaps I made on my first attempt at paint pouring, and share some tips I have picked up to help you hopefully get a better result the first time.</p>

                  <h2>The Magic of Derwent Inktense</h2>
                  <p>Inktense pencils and blocks offer great versatility - use them dry like a colour pencil or bring the pigments to life by using them with water. Once they become activated and left to dry the colours become permanent allowing you to safely layer them many times. Their permanency and solubility makes them fabulous for using on their own to create loose punchy watercolour paintings. I have created this tutorial and video using Inktense pencils and paper, I hope you enjoy painting along!
