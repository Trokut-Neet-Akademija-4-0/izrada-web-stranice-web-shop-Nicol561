            <h1>Which Is The Whitest White Pencil?</h1>

            <p>Cherry Ferris</p>

            <p>December 27, 2023</p>

            <p>I don't know about you but as a mixed media artist I'm continually on the search for the best white pens, acrylic markers and pencils to use as highlights on a variety of surfaces. I'm always on the look out for that strong bright whitest of white! In this article I will share with you some of the pencils that I have tested on different surfaces to find my favourite.</p>

            <h2>What I look for in a white pencil</h2>

            <img src="/web.shop/images/picture_products/blog-white-pencils.jpg" alt="Slika" class="blog-image1">

            <p>For me 'whites' fall into two categories, wet (markers, posca pens etc) or dry (colour pencils, dry watercolour pencils, un-activated inktense etc.) and I use different products for different things. For the purposes of todays fun exercise I'll be looking at dry media.</p>

            <p>So what do I look for? Well…my main criteria for my studio work is opacity (how well does it cover), blendability (does it play well with other mediums), flexibility (does it work on different supports) and brightness (I want a white that shines out).</p>

            <p>I've used a handful of different white pencils on two challenging surfaces, black card stock and a sanded wood panel …. just look at the difference!</p>

            <h3>Stabilo 'Write All' 8052</h3>

            <p>All purpose marking pencil for glass, plastic, metal and wood. It has highly pigmented colour which gives strong lines and it's easy to sharpen. It is however water soluble so will wipe off with a wet cloth.</p>

            <h3>Derwent Drawing 'Chinese White' 7200</h3>

            <p>Soft creamy textured pencil with a unique waxy consistency that produces a smooth velvety opaque finish on wood without having to press too hard. It sharpens to a great point and have a light fast rating of 8 (very high). In these two tests it produced the brightest, most stable, saturated colour on black paper and it was the easiest pencil to use on sanded wood.</p>

            <h3>Derwent Procolour 'Chinese White' 72</h3>

            <p>Procolour Pencils are the perfect combination of a strong point and smooth lay down. The texture of the lead is quite firm and works great on paper with the strong covering power of a wax, yet glides like an oil pencil. However on wood the firmer lead tends to skip resulting in a patchy cover, even on a well sanded surface.</p>

            <h3>Luminance 6901 'White' 001</h3>

            <p>Luminance pencils are also another fabulous lightfast pencil range and are created with exhibition and collectible artworks in mind. They layer really well and have a wonderful creamy, saturated coverage. I really love their muted colour range and often integrate the pencils into my mixed media work. The white is a lovely soft 'angels' white rather than a 'brilliant' white. Remember though … this experiment was using just one quick pass of the pencils.</p>

            <h3>Derwent Lightfast 'White' 2718</h3>

            <p>The Lightfast coloured pencil is one of Derwent's premium pencils and another one of my absolute favourites on paper or pastel boards. They also layer wonderfully with Polychromos pencils. They are an oil based pencil and can be sharpened to a lovely point for the most intricate of detail. I find them rich and beautifully pigmented. The pencil covered well on the sanded wood panel however, it didn't cover as well in one pass as the softer, more waxy pencils.</p>

            <h3>Prismacolor Premier 'White Blanc' PC 938</h3>

            <p>The soft waxy, thick cores are perfect for laying down blanket cover and bright highlights. The pencils are lightfast and offer richly saturated pigments, however they require constant sharpening to maintain a sharp point and the lead breaks very easily. This pencil came a close second in both tests. Prismacolor Verithin 'Blanc 743' is similar but has a thinner lead.</p>

            <h3>Derwent Inktense 'Antique White 2300'</h3>

            <p>A fabulous versatile ink based pencil with intense saturated colour and lots of secrets up its sleeve. They can be used dry or wet and are fabulous for mixed media projects.</p>

            <h3>Faber Castell Polychromos 'Weiss White' 9201-101</h3>

            <p>Polychromos are my normal go-to for coloured pencil work because they offer highly light-fast vivid colours as well as smudge-proof and water-resistant properties. However, on wood the harder oil based leads, although highly break-resistant, tend to skip across the grain resulting in a patchy weak colour.</p>

            <h2>In Conclusion</h2>

            <p>If you're looking for a go to 'dry' white pencil with an bright creamy coverage in just one simple pass then the top spot (and one of my absolute favourites for such purposes) is the 'Derwent Drawing Chinese White 7200'. It covers well on a number of surfaces including wood and even on black card, and I'm continually impressed by its ease of use, strength of colour and robustness of the lead (it's nice and chunky).</p>

            <p>I would happily use many of the other pencils and pencil ranges for different  projects and art pieces. If I was looking for blendability, realism, colour range or  working in a particular surface I would maybe reach for something different. My motto is always play and explore with your materials.  What works for one may not always work for another and constantly keep in mind your purpose and the outcome. </p>
