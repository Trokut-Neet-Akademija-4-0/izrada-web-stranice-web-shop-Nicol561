                  <h2>Colour Theory to Improve Your Paintings</h2>
                  <p>Colour theory is an almost endless area of research that can feel a little daunting, especially if you are only beginning on your creative journey. However, there are a few simple strategies that can ease you into the wonderful benefits that knowledge of colour theory can bring.
                  I have learnt these strategies from a variety of sources; from long-established artists encountered on art holidays passing their information to me, to formal arts education and also my own wandering experimentations.
                  I won't go into detail about all my colour theory knowledge, but instead, would like to provide 3 simple strategies that will make a big difference to your work.</p>

                  <h2>The Ultimate Guide to Vegan Art Supplies</h2>
                  <p>Veganism encompasses all elements of your lifestyle - which extends to the materials you choose to make art with too. While many of our creative predecessors relied on the use of animal materials in their art supplies, we now have way more choice in what's available. Although there has been a massive increase in the number of vegan artists, it's not always obvious what is and isn't suitable for vegans. Here we've gathered together some information about vegan-friendly materials to help you shop.</p>

                  <p>Coloured pencils are a match made in heaven for botanical subjects, precision and detail. They are portable, forgiving and accessible and by using layering techniques they offer you the ability to create and reproduce vibrant pure colours on the page which are a joy to behold. As the seasons change and the cooler months make their way to our doorsteps, what can be nicer than filling our artistic world with the colour and pizazz of wonderful botanical art. In this article I will share with you some tricks of the trade using Derwent's Procolour pencils and how to create the perfect green.
