                <h2>Introducing Da Vinci's Colineo Synthetic Watercolour Brushes</h2>
                <p>I love watercolour brushes and so I was very excited to try out Da Vinci's new synthetic, vegan watercolour brushes. Many brush manufacturers have invested resources into creating a synthetic brush range and there are now a growing number on the market. The development of synthetic brush ranges has been driven by a number of factors including the price of sable and other animal hair, sustainability and lifestyle choices. Let's check out how Da Vinci's Colineo range performs. </p>

                  <h2>How To Use Soft Pastels</h2>
                  <p>Fundamentally I'm an abstract painter and when I start to paint I seldom know what I plan to do.
