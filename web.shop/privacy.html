We use this information to better understand how visitors find us and how they interact with our website. We can use this to make adjustments to our website, to deliver a better user experience.  </p>

      <p> We also use tracking from Facebook and Pinterest so that we can better understand how visitors are interacting with our site via social media and to track the effectiveness of any adverts we place on social media.</p>
        
        <p>This data is all anonymised but you can opt out of this tracking at any time via your own browser settings. See our Cookie Policy for more details.</p>

       <h4>Contact Forms and Email Links</h4>
       <p>
       Should you choose to contact us using the contact form on our Contact Us Page, none of the data that you supply will be stored by this website or passed to / be processed by any of the third-party data processors defined in section below.  Instead the data will be collated into an email and sent to us over the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Our SMTP servers are protected by TLS (sometimes known as SSL) meaning that the email content is encrypted using SHA-2, 256-bit cryptography before being sent across the internet. The email content is then decrypted by our local computers and devices.

       <p>
       We store information on our own secure servers

       <p>Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.</p>

       <p>Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. GA also records your computer's IP address which could be used to personally identify you but Google do not grant us access to this. We consider Google to be a third-party data processor (see Third-Party Processors below).</p>

       <p>GA makes use of cookies, details of which can be found on Google's developer guides. Disabling cookies on your internet browser will stop GA from tracking any part of your visit to pages within this website.</p>
