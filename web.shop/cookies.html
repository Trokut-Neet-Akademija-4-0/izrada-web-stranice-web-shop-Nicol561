    <h3>What are 'cookies'?</h3>

    <p>In common with many other website operators, we use cookies on our website. We use them to enrich your experience of using the website by allowing us to tailor what you see to what we have learned about your preferences during your visits to the site. Our cookies are also used to enable us to develop our website to reflect our customers interests by noting who has seen which pages and advertisements, how frequently particular pages are visited and determining the most popular areas of our website. We and carefully selected third parties also use cookies to show you more relevant advertising online.</p>
    <p>
    In general, we use the following types of cookie:</p>
    <p>
    Strictly Necessary cookies: These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website, use the shopping cart feature when buying products etc.</p>
    <p>
    Analytical/Performance cookies: These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users can find what they are looking for easily.</p>
    <p>
    Functionality cookies: These are used to improve the functional performance of the website and make it easier for you to use. For example, they are used to remember that you have previously visited the website and asked to remain logged in to the website. </p>
    <p>
    Targeting cookies: These are used to record your visit to our website along with your browsing habits, such as the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. They are used to deliver advertising which is more relevant to your interests and also may be used to limit the number of times that you see an advertisement. They may be placed by us or by advertising networks with our permission.  Please note, these cookies do not contain any of your personal information. For details on how to manage cookies and how to opt out of targeted marking see below. </p>

    <h3>What are first-party and third-party cookies?</h3>
     <p>
    First-party cookies are saved to your computer by the website that you are on.</p>

    <p>Third-party cookies are saved to your computer by a website that gives content to the one that you are on. So, if you watch a YouTube video on our website, YouTube may save its own cookie to your computer.</p>
    <p> A website can only read the cookies that it makes. So, other websites cannot read the cookies we save to your computer and we cannot read any cookies saved by them.</p>
