    <h3>Privacy</h3>


    <p>Cass Art complies fully with all relevant Data Protection and consumer legislation and treats all personal information as fully confidential. We collect your personal information (for example, your name, email address etc) when you subscribe to our mailing list, enter competitions and provide feedback; when you place orders, we collect your name, email and delivery address and payment details, to service your order. Personal information is stored on secure servers, and details such as credit card, name and address are encrypted. Cass Art complies with Tier 3 PCI (Payment Card Industry), which guarantees the highest level of security and protection of customer information.</p>

    <p>Cass Art will not share your details with third parties unless you give us permission to do so. However, to perform credit-card transactions and fulfil orders, Cass Art uses reputable third-party banking and distribution institutions. These carefully selected companies receive only the information needed to verify and authorise payment cards and to process orders and are under strict legal obligations to keep all personal information private.</p>

    <div class="terms">
    <h3>Orders</h3>

    <p>Orders will be charged to your account on dispatch of goods. All credit and charge card payments are subject to checks and authorisation by the card issuer; if the issuer does not authorise payment, your order will be cancelled and Cass Art will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery.</p>

    <p>Please note that stock levels shown on the website are a guide only, that product colour may be different from that shown due to variation caused by your computer screen or device, and that any colour swatches provided are supplied as a guide only. In the rare event that a product ordered has been listed with incorrect details or is supplied to Cass Art in different packaging than shown, we'll inform you prior to dispatch and ask you to confirm your order or cancel it. If we cannot get hold of you, we will cancel the order and will either not take payment from you or give you a full refund, as applicable.
    We reserve the right to refuse an order at our discretion, and cannot be held liable for withdrawing any goods, materials or content from the site.</p>

    <h3>Delivery</h3>

     <p>Cass Art dispatches orders every working day. Working days are Monday to Friday, excluding Bank Holidays. Standard Delivery takes between 3 and 5 working days to most areas of mainland Britain. We also offer Next Day and Same Day delivery options where available please see our delivery information page for full details.
    We will send an email to the address you provided on registration (as may be updated) when your order has been dispatched, including any information on how to track your order. Delivery notes are passed onto the courier to assist them in delivering your order. They are not instructions that the courier will always follow.</p>
    
    <p>We ensure each purchase during the time it is in transit until it is delivered to the specified delivery address. Once your order has been delivered to the specified delivery address, the contract between Cass Art and yourself will be marked as fulfilled and the responsibility from that stage has transferred onto you. If you have specified a recipient who is not you for delivery purposes (for example as a gift) then you accept that evidence of a signature by them (or at that delivery address) is evidence of delivery and fulfilment by Cass Art and transfer of responsibility in the same way.</p>

    <p>Our couriers can deliver to certain destinations without collecting a signature. If this option applies to your delivery address, you can update your preference on the shipping page at checkout by entering a delivery note before proceeding to purchase. By instructing the courier to leave your order in a safe place, you agree to our terms and conditions and take full responsibility for any loss or damage that may occur.
    Cass Art does not accept any liability for failure or delay in delivering goods or for any damage or defect to goods, in each case, that is caused by any event or circumstance beyond its reasonable control.</p>
